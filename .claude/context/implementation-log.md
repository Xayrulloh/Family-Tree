Append a bullet here after each session with: date, what was built/changed, and any key decisions made.

## 2026-06-13 — Claude Code setup
- Created `.claude/` project directory with `settings.json` (MCP GitHub server + allowed tool permissions)
- Created `CLAUDE.md` root index pointing to all context files
- Created `.claude/context/`: project.md, db.md, api.md, web.md, cloudflare.md, shared.md, implementation-log.md
- Created `.claude/commands/`: remember.md, compact.md, create-pr.md
- `settings.local.json` holds the GitHub token (gitignored)
- Added `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore`
- **Note:** GitHub token was exposed in chat — rotate it at github.com/settings/tokens
